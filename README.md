Notes
1. When testing or implementing new function, DO NOT commit directly to the main branch, DO create a new branch and start a new pull request, and later push the changes


Common Troubleshooting:
1. "Updates were rejected because the remote contains work that you do hint: not have locally", pull from remote repo first before pushing for the first time.
2. Matlab cannot add files under sub-folders in a batch, to do that, use the git command line by installing git to your PC. CD to the local repo folder and use the command "git add .", the dot means all files, specify files if needed.
To revert addition to "staged" changes, use "git reset .", specify files if needed.
