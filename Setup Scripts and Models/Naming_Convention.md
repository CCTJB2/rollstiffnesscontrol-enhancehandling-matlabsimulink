# Naming Convention for Setup Scripts and Models

<p>
This "Setup Scripts and Models" folder is for keeping any scripts and models not generated by CarMaker or is not in the CM4SL simulink model format.  
  
Do not put any other scripts or models in the src/cm4sl folder without valid reason or before discussing with the team.  
  
To modularize our development and avoid update conflicts in the Parent CM4SL parent model, the subfunctions and scripts are developed seperately and integrate together in the CM4SL parent model with the "Model" simulink block.

The naming convention goes as follows, all ways use lower case (unless it is for abbreviation), but use underscores for matlab (unlike for github we use hyphens).

## [type][subfunctioncode][modelorscriptnumber]\_[function]\_[method]

## examples:  
s0301_yawcontrol_LQR2I2O (simulink model for yaw control by LQR with 2 inputs and 2 outputs)  
s0302_yawcontrol_LQR4I2O (simulink model for yaw control by LQR with 4 inputs and 2 outputs)  
m0301_yawcontrol_LQR2I2O (script that complements s0301)  
  
  
## type:  
(1) 'm' for matlab script (including live scripts)  
(2) 's' for simulink model

## subfunctioncode:  
(00) Scenario and Maneuvre  
(01) Reference Generation  
(02) Vehicle Dynamics  
(03) Controller  
(04) Actuator  
(05) State Estimator  

## modelorscriptnumber:  
TWO DIGIT order number according to time of creation or functional order, free to be defined by the subteam.
Only requirement is to keep model and script order number paired, for example there can be a s0001 and also a m0001, first one is a simulink model, second one is a matlab script that complimants the s0001 model, if a script is created but do not have corresponding model, leave the corresponding model order number unused. See below as example for controller (using subfunction code 03).  
|   Model           | Script              |  
|   s0301           | m0301              |  
| (no paired model) | m0302              |    
|   s0303           | (no paired script) |  
|   s0304           | m0304              |  
  
  
## function:
describe function of the script or model  

## method:
describe how is it achieved
